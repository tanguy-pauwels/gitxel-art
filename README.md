## Introduction

**Gitxel-Art** is a fun and creative way to add pixel art to your GitHub contributions graph! 
By generating a series of commits, you can create images on your GitHub profile directly in the contributions graph. 
Whether youâ€™re looking to display your artistic skills or just have a little fun with GitHub's contribution calendar, 
Gitxel-Art allows you to do just that.

This project uses a *grid-based* approach to map pixel art into your contribution graph,
where each "pixel" corresponds to one or more commit on a specific day of the year. 
The result is a colorful and unique visual representation of your contributions. 
You can either generate your own pixel art or use the default Space Invader image provided for testing.

This tool is under [MIT license](LICENSE.md).

## Installation and setup

### Setup Gitxel-Art

git clone [url-repo]

#### Activate a virtual Environment

##### For Unix-based systems (Linux | macOS)

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

##### Windows system 

```shell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:


```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Setup your GitHub Repository:
This repository will be used to push the commits that generate your pixel art.

Create a New Repository:
- Go to your GitHub profile and create a new repository (Private is recommended).
- Make sure to choose a name that fits your project, for example, dummy_repo.

#### Initialize the Repository

```shell
git init
git branch -M main
git remote set-url origin [your-github-repo-url]```

```



#### Configure Git (if it's your first time using Git)

If you haven't used Git before, set up your global Git configuration with your name and email:

```shell
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```
**/!\ The email you use must match the email associated with your GitHub account.**

## Usage 

To run Gitxel-Art, simply execute the following command:

```shell
python main.py
```
Ouput:

![img](media/launch.png)

- If you don't specify an image path, the script will automatically use the default Space Invader image:

![img2](media/default_image.png)

- You don't need to convert your image to grayscale; the script will handle this for you.

The script will guide you through a series of questions:

![img3](media/all_steps.png)

If you respond `yes` to the last question (`Do you want to run in preview mode`)

the script will generate a mock GitHub contributions graph for you to preview your art:
If you want to apply your image on your github profile 
you have to re-run the script with the same parameters and answer `not` to the last question.
![img4](media/mocked_graph.png)

If you choose not to run in preview mode, the script will create the corresponding commits and push them to your GitHub profile:

![img5](media/commit_push.png)

Then, you will see your beautiful artwork displayed on your GitHub profile:

![github_after](media/github_after.png)

## Removing Your Pixel Art from GitHub

To remove your pixel art from your GitHub profile, simply delete the repository you created for generating the commits. 
*For example*, if your repository is named `dummy_repo, deleting it will remove the commits from your profile:

![remove](media/remove_art.png)

## Notes

- You can run the script as many times as you'd like, with different images and configurations.
- The script will always generate a new set of commits for each image and year you specify.
- Make sure your repository remains private unless you want others to see your dummy_file.
- If your repository is private, make sure to activate the `private contribution` on your contribution graph's setting:
